# Imports moved to new modules: heuristics.py, ml_sim.py, visualization.py, main.py
# This file now only contains ML simulation and sequence search logic.
# See main.py for CLI and mode selection.
# See heuristics.py for heuristic move logic.
# See visualization.py for plotting and HTML output.

# All logic has been moved to ml_sim.py, heuristics.py, and visualization.py.
# This file is now a stub for legacy compatibility and documentation.

# If you want to run the ML simulation, use main.py as the entry point.
